## Notes

1. Connect the RJ45 cable from the adapter board to the RJ45 plug labeled "INPUT".
2. Connect the RJ45 cable to the next signal from the "OUTPUT" plug.
3. If you do not connect an outgoing RJ45 cable, you can set the jumper JP1 to "ON" to route the data signal back to the adapter board. See more at the [adapter board README](../ws2811-adapter/README.md).
